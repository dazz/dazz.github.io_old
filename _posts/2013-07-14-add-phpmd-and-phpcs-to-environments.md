So clean code matters. To the company, the team, the project and me. A set of rules which define how the code is styled, how long methods are and how sharp the edges feel when you bump them.

## The tools

There are two tools which define and check the adherence of rules. **[PHP Mess Detector](http://phpmd.org/)** and **[PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.php-codesniffer.advanced-usage.php)**. They bring a good set of rules from where it is easy to start to customize.

There are different times when to let the checks run.

* In the Ide (PhpStorm)
* With every commit
* With every pull request
* With test runs (on travis)

Let them be part of your continuous deployment. You have your custom rules in the company or even project? Use the [PHP Coding Standard Generator](http://edorian.github.io/php-coding-standard-generator/#phpmd) (thanks edorian).

But before you start creating your own ruleset consider the following: Removing the standard rules means they are violated somewhere in the codebase and it can not always be insured it happened only at places that where known.

So a better handling would be to add annotations with Mess Detector and comments with Code Sniffer. The advantage is that violations are documented and eventually fixed.

Suppress Mess Detector warnings:

{% highlight php startinline linenos=table %}
/**
 * This will suppress UnusedLocalVariable warnings in this method
 *
 * @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.UnusedLocalVariable)
 */
public function foo() {
    $baz = 42;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Suppress Codesniffer warnings:

{% highlight php startinline linenos=table %}
// @codingStandardsIgnoreStart
$xmlPackage['error_code'] = get_default_error_code_value();
// @codingStandardsIgnoreEnd
{% endhighlight %}

## In PhpStorm

To integrate the two tools in PhpStorm:

### Set the code style

* **Settings > Code Style > PHP > Set from ...**


### Add the pathes

* **Settings > PHP > Mess Detector** add the path to phpmd i.e. `/usr/bin/phpmd`

* **Settings > PHP > Code Sniffer** add the path to phpcs i.e. `/usr/bin/phpcs`

### Add the inspections

* **Settings > Inspections > PHP**
* Check **PHP Code Sniffer validation** and
* Check **PHP Mess Detector validation**

There in this deeply buried menu you can also add your own PHP Coding Standard rules.

And voil√° the warnings appear where the rules are violated.

## On Travis

Add phpmd in `composer.json`:

{% highlight json startinline linenos=table %}

{
  "require-dev": {
    "phpunit/phpunit": "3.7.*",
    "phpmd/phpmd": "*"
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Add the tools to `.travis.yml`:

{% highlight yaml startinline linenos=table %}
language: php

before_script:
  - pear install PHP_CodeSniffer
  - phpenv rehash
  - ./composer.phar install --dev --prefer-source --no-interaction

php:
  - 5.3
  - 5.4

script:
  - phpcs --standard=psr2 ./src
  - ./vendor/bin/phpmd src/ text codesize,unusedcode,naming,phpmd.xml
  - ./vendor/bin/phpunit
{% endhighlight %}
